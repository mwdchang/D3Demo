Demos
=====
Collection of web-based visualization and graphics programs: demos, proof-of-concepts and other things.

In a nutshell, this is my playground for web and Javascript related things. All programs are self-contained in their individual folders, some may need a local webserver (python SimpleHttpServer, node Express ... etc) for getting around browers' strict permissions.
